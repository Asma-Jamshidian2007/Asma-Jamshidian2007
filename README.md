## 🤔 - Why?

> When I was 11 years old, I liked to be a doctor or a nurse,But I've liked computers from childhood until now that I choose my target.
I was always curious about everything and I didn't give up until I get the answer I wanted. Every time I researched about computers,
> I didn't get the answer I wanted, and this made the subject more interesting to me.
> I have been curious about computers for three years and I realized that my interest in computers has increased
> Finally, I was drawn to the world of technology and embraced it.
